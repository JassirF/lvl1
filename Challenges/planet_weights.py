# The year is 2199... we have become an interplanetary species and can travel to other planets in the solar system! ðŸš€

# Create a weight conversion program that:

# Ask the user what their Earth weight is.
# Ask the user for a number that correlates with a planet.
# Calculate the user's weight on the destination planet.
# To calculate user's weight:

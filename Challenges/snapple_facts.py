# Snapple is a famous tea drink brand from Queens, New York. Each bottle cap comes with a silly fun fact.

# Here are six Snapple facts:

# Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.
# The only food that doesnâ€™t spoil is honey.
# Shrimp can only swim backwards.
# The lifespan of a taste bud is about 10 days.
# It is impossible to sneeze while sleeping.
# It is illegal to sing off-key in North Carolina.
# Use the random module to create a number from 0 to 5.

# Then use an if/elif/else statement to print out one of these random facts.
